# wolf3d
In this project we had to recreate a simple version of Wolfenstein3d..
The program has to be linked to a graphics library the library is called minilibx the source code can be found on the internet and obviously changes have to be make to the in order for it compile and run. If ever you want to run then you'll have to figure out how to change the Makefile and the code for the program to work.
